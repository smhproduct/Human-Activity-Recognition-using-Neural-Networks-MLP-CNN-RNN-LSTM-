# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Neural-Networks-MLP-CNN-RNN-LSTM-

## How to run the code
Do the following step to get the code up and running on your computer-

	1. Download the UCI HAR Dataset.zip file from	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
	2. Click on the ‘Data Folder’ option in the above link and then click on the ‘UCI HAR Dataset.zip’ file to start downloading.
	3. Extract the zip file inside the directory "/Human Activity Recognition/Datasets/"
	4. Open the project in your IDE (used Spyder)
	5. Go to main.py
	6. Change model name in line 40 and line 24 as preferred (Should be either of: MLP/ CNN/ RNN/  LSTM)
	7. Run the code from main.py
